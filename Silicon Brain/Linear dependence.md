## Definition
Linear dependence is a property of a set of [[Vectors|vectors]] where a vector in that set can be described as a linear combination of other vectors in that set, which can include itself.

That is, if a subset of that set and a set of scalars exists such that the linear combination of each vector in that subset scaled by its corresponding scalar results in a vector that exists in the superset of vectors, the superset is said to be linearly dependent.

**Linear independence** is the property of a set not being linearly dependent. ^200e9f
