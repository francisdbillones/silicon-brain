## Definition
A prism is a [[Polyhedron|polyhedron]] which 2 congruent and parallel faces (called bases), which are connected by [[Parallelograms|parallelograms]].

![[Prism_2022-02-16 13.50.43.excalidraw]]

The shaded [[Triangle|triangles]] on the top and bottom are the 2 congruent and parallel faces, while the [[Rectangle|rectangles]] on the sides are the parallelograms that connect these faces.

The **altitude** is the line segment perpendicular to both bases, and connects them.
The **height** of the prism is the length of this altitude.

### Regular prism
A regular prism is a prism with [[Polygon#Regular polygon|regular polygons]] as its bases.

### Right prism
A right prism is a prism where the angle between its lateral edges and its bases are $90 \degree$.

#### Lateral area
$L = Ph$
where $P$ is the perimeter of the base and $h$ is the height of the right prism.

#### Total surface area
$T = L + 2B$
where $B$ is the surface area of the right prism's base.

#### Volume
$V = Bh$
where $B$ is the area of the right prism's base while $h$ is the height of the right prism.
