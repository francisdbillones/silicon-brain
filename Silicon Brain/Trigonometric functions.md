#### Sine function
The sine function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$sin(\theta) = y$

#### Cosine function
The cosine function is defined as the $x$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$cos(\theta) = x$

#### Tangent function
The tangent function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the $x$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$
