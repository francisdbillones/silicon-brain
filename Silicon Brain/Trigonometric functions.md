## List of trigonometric functions

#### Sine function
The sine function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$sin(\theta) = y$

##### Arcsine function
The arcsine function is the inverse function of the sine function.

$arcsine(\theta) = sin^{-1}(\theta)$
$arcsine(sin(\theta)) = \theta$

The range of arcsine is strictly limited to $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. This is to prevent arcsine from being multi-valued; as the sine function is periodic, there are infinity many inputs to the sine function that yield the same output. As such, arcsine will have infinitely many outputs for the same input without this restriction.

#### Cosine function
The cosine function is defined as the $x$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$

$cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$cos(\theta) = x$

##### Arccosine function
The arccosine function is the inverse function of the cosine function.

$arccos(\theta) = cos^{-1}(\theta)$
$arccosine(cos(\theta)) = \theta$

The range of arccosine is strictly limited to $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.

#### Tangent function
The tangent function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the $x$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$

The tangent function is also the ratio of sine and cosine.
$tan(\theta) = \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$

##### Arctangent function
The arctangent function is the inverse function of the tangent function.

$arctan(\theta) = tan^{-1}(\theta)$
$arctan(tan(\theta)) = \theta$

#### Cosecant function
The cosecant function is defined as the hypotenuse divided by the $y$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$csc(\theta) = \frac{t}{y}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{y}$
The cosecant function is also the reciprocal of the sine function.
$csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{sin(\theta)}$

##### Arccosecant function
The arccosecant function is the inverse function of the cosecant function.

$arccsc(\theta) = csc^{-1}(\theta)$
$arccsc(csc(\theta)) = \theta$

The range of arccosine is strictly limited to $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.

#### Secant function
The secant function is defined as the hypotenuse divided by the $x$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$sec(\theta) = \frac{t}{x}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}$
The secant function is also the reciprocal of the cosine function.
$sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{cos(\theta)}$

##### Arcsecant function
The arcsecant function is the inverse function of the secant function.

$arcsec(\theta) = sec^{-1}(\theta)$

#### Cotangent function
The cotangent function is defined as the $x$ component divided by the $y$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y}$

The cotangent function is also the ratio of cosine and sine.
$cot(\theta) = \frac{cos(\theta)}{sin(\theta)}$
The cotangent function is also the reciprocal of tangent.
$cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{tan(\theta)}$

##### Arccotangent function
The arccotagent function is the inverse function of the cotangent function.

$arccot(\theta) = cot^{-1}(\theta)$
$arccot(cot(\theta)) = \theta$

The range of arccotangent is strictly limited to $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
