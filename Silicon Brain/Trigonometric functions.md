## List of trigonometric functions

#### Sine function
The sine function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$sin(\theta) = y$

#### Cosine function
The cosine function is defined as the $x$ component divided by the hypotenuse of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{t}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$cos(\theta) = x$

#### Tangent function
The tangent function is defined as the $y$ component divided by the $x$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$

The tangent function is also the ratio of sine and cosine.
$tan(\theta) = \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$

#### Cosecant function
The cosecant function is defined as the hypotenuse divided by the $y$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$csc(\theta) = \frac{t}{y}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{y}$
The cosecant function is also the reciprocal of the sine function.
$csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{sin(\theta)}$

#### Secant function
The secant function is defined as the hypotenuse divided by the $x$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$sec(\theta) = \frac{t}{x}$

Scaling down to the unit circle, this can be simplified to
$sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}$
The secant function is also the reciprocal of the cosine function.
$sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{cos(\theta)}$

#### Cotangent function
The cotangent function is defined as the $x$ component divided by the $y$ component of the point $P$ at the end of the arc with arc length $r$.

$cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y}$

The cotangent function is also the ratio of cosine and sine.
$cot(\theta) = \frac{cos(\theta)}{sin(\theta)}$
The cotangent function is also the reciprocal of tangent.
$cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{tan(\theta)}$
