## Definition
A circle is a set of points in 2D space that are equidistant to some center.

### Equation of a circle
A circle may be described using the following equation:
$$
(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 = r^2
$$
where $c$ is the center and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

### Area of a circle
The area of the circle is described by the following equation:
$$
	A = {\pi}r^2
$$
where $\pi$ or "[[Pi|pi]]" is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

### Circumference of a circle
The circumference of a circle is described by the following equation:
$$
C = 2{\pi}r
$$

### Arc

An arc is a continuous section of a circle's circumference.

An arc that has a length greater than half of the circle's circumference is called a **minor arc**, while a **major arc** is vice versa.

### Sector
A sector is a region bounded by an [[Circle#^cb8a31|arc]].

#### Area of a sector
The area of a sector is described using the following equation:
$$
	A_{sec} = \frac{\theta_{sec}}{2\pi}A_{circle}
$$
It is simply the fractional area described by the ratio of the angle of the sector with the angle of the entire circle.
