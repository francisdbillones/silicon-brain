	[[Philippine Congress|Congress]] is held accountable by the [[Philippine Executive|Executive]] branch via its veto power, which can be superseded by [[Philippine Congress|Congress]] with a supermajority (2/3) vote of each House.
	
	The [[Philippine Judiciary|Judiciary]] has the power to declare acts by the [[Philippine Legislature|Legislative]] branch as invalid subject to its interpretation of the 1987 Constitution.

2. **Holding the [[Philippine Executive|Executive]] accountable**
	Amnesty proclaimed by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] can be vetoed by [[Philippine Congress|Congress]].

	The [[Philippine Judiciary|Judiciary]] has the power to declare acts by the Executive branch as [[Philippine Executive|Executive]] subject to its interpretation of the 1987 Constitution.

3. **Holding the [[Philippine Judiciary|Judiciary]] accountable**
	[[Philippine Congress|Congress]] has the authority to limit the powers of the Supreme Court and its lower courts.
