## Definition
A [[Polygon|polygonal]] region is the union of a finite number of triangular regions in 2D space, such that if any 2 of them intersect, their intersection is either a line or a point.

There may be an infinite amount of possible triangular regions within a polygonal region.

### Area postulate
A polygonal region corresponds to a positive real number, that represents the area of the region.

### Congruence postulate
Two [[Polygon|polygons]] that are congruent have the same area.

### Area addition postulate
Two polygonal regions that intersect only in edges and vertices have a combined area of the sum of their respective areas.

### Unit postulate for area
The area of a square region is the square of the length of its edge.
