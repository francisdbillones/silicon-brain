## Definition
A cylinder is a closed geometric figure made up of 2 parallel bases which are either [[Ellipse|elliptical]] or [[Circle|circular]], joined by a single curved surface.

The **axis** of the cylinder is the line segment connecting the centers of both bases.
The **altitude** is the line segment perpendicular to both bases.
All axes are altitudes, but not all altitudes are axes.
The **height** of the cylinder is the length of the altitude.

---

### Right cylinder
A right cylinder has an axis perpendicular to both bases.

---

### Circular cylinder
A circular cylinder has circular bases.

---

### Right circular cylinder
A right circular cylinder is both right and circular.

#### Lateral area
$L = Ch = 2{\pi}rh$
where $L$ is the lateral area, $C$ is the circumference of the base, and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

#### Total surface area
$T = L + 2B$
where $T$ is the total surface area, $L$ is the lateral surface area, and $B$ is the area of the base.

---
### Volume of any cylinder
$V = Bh$,
where $V$ is the volume of the cylinder, $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
