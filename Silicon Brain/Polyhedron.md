## Definition
A polyhedron is a 3D geometric figure that is made up of a number of [[Polygon|polygonal]] surfaces which are joined along their sides and encloses a region.

The [[Polygon|polygons]] that make up the polyhedron are called **faces**, the sides of these polygons are called **edges**, and the points where these edges intersect are called **vertices**.

### Unit cube
A unit cube is a cube with sides of length 1.

### Volume postulate
Every polyhedron corresponds with a positive real number that describes the number of unit cubes inside the region of space that the polyhedron encapsulates. This real number is the volume of the polyhedron.
