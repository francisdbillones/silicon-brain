## Definition
A circular cone is a closed geometric figure made up of a [[Circle|circular]] base and a vertex, both of which are joined by a single curved surface.

![[Circular cone_2022-02-16 16.26.45.excalidraw]]
The **altitude** or **axis** is the line segment connecting the center of the base and the vertex.
The **lateral surface** is the curved plane connecting the vertex and the base.
The **slant height** is the length of the line segment connecting the vertex and any point on the circular base.

### Right circular cone
A right circular cone has an axis perpendicular to the base.

#### Lateral surface area
$L = \frac{1}{2}Cl = {\pi}rl$
where $C$ is the circumference of the base, $r$ is the radius of the base, and $l$ is the slant height.

#### Total surface area
$T = L + B = {\pi}rl + {\pi}r^2$
where $L$ is the lateral area of the cone, $B$ is the area of the base, $r$ is the radius of the base and $l$ is the slant height.

#### Volume of any cone
$V = \frac{1}{3}Bh = \frac{1}{3}{\pi}r^2h$
where $B$ is the area of the base, $h$ is the height (length of the altitude), and $r$ is the radius of the base.
