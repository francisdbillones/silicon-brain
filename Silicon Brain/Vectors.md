## Definition
Vectors comprise one of the main algebraic structures in [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]].

Vectors are a special kind of [[Matrices|matrix]], with dimensions $(1, c)$ (known as row vectors) or dimensions $(r,1)$ (known as column vectors).

There are 3 main views on the definition of vectors:

1. **Physics view**
	The physics view defines vectors as "lines" or "arrows" in an n-dimensional space that represents a magnitude and a direction in that space. As such, vectors are used to represent forces, movement, etc.

2. **Computer science view**
	From a computer science view, vectors are simply 1-dimensional arrays of numbers. For example, a students' grades can be represented as a vector.

3. **Mathematics view**
	From a mathematics view, vectors are any object that has a well-defined addition operation with objects of its kind and a well-defined multiplication operator with scalars to produce objects of its kind. Physics vectors and even polynomials fit these requirements, and as such, are mathematical vectors. Audio signals are vectors as well.

### Vector spaces
A vector space is the set of all [[Vectors|vectors]] that can be constructed from a finite set of vectors, which we call the basis vectors, by performing the operations of addition, and multiplication by a scalar.
