## Definition
Vectors comprise one of the main algebraic structures in [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]].

There are 3 main views on the definition of vectors:

1. **Physics view**
	The physics view defines vectors as "lines" or "arrows" in an n-dimensional space that represents a magnitude and a direction in that space. As such, vectors are used to represent forces, movement, etc.

2. **Computer science view**
	From a computer science view, vectors are simply 1-dimensional arrays of numbers. For example, a students' grades can be represented as a vector.

3. **Mathematics view**
	From a mathematics view, vectors are any object that has a well-defined addition operator with objects of its kind and a well-defined multiplication operator with scalars to produce objects of its kind. Thus, physics vectors and even polynomials are mathematical vectors. Audio signals are vectors as well.
