What are [[Vectors|vectors]]?

From a physics point of a view, a vector is a mathematical object with a direction and a magnitude.

From a computer science point of view, a vector is simply an array of numbers. Imagine you're buying a house, what would you care about? You'd care about the location of the house (represented in latitude and longitude), the size of the house, the price of the house, interest, etc. All of this can be represented by an array of numbers, and you can plot this array of numbers as if they were coordinates in some space.

What are [[Matrices|matrices]]?

Matrices are 2D arrays of numbers. You can think of them as a vector of vectors.
