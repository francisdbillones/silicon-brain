## Definition
A pyramid is a [[Polyhedron|polyhedron]] where each of the faces, except one, have a common vertex.

![[Pyramid_2022-02-16 16.36.55.excalidraw]]
The **base** is the face that does not connect to the vertex.
The **base edges** are the edges of the base.
The **altitude** is the line segment perpendicular to the base, passing through the vertex.
The **lateral faces** are the faces that connect with the vertex.
The **lateral edges** are the edges of each lateral face.
The **slant height** is the distance from the vertex to any base edge, perpendicular to the base edge.

### Regular pyramid
A pyramid is regular if its base is a [[Polygon#Regular polygon|regular polygon]] and its lateral edges are equal in length.

#### Surface area
$T = L + B$
where $T$ is the total surface area, $L$ is the lateral surface area $L = \frac{1}{2}Pl$, and $B$ is the area of the base.

#### Volume
$V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$
where $V$ is the total volume, $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height (or the length of the altitude).
