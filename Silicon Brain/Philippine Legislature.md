3. The bill shall be presented to the [[President of the Philippines|President]]. If they veto the bill, it will be returned with their objects to the House from which it originated from for reconsideration. A supermajority (2/3) vote must pass said House, in which case it will be passed to the other House which will do the same, and if it passes it shall become a law.
